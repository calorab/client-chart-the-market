## User Cases

1.  I picture this app being used by some users who want to learn investing - specifically technical investing - without risking their money. 
2.  The second would be for those who would like to use the app as a way to find investments they want to invest in through search and charting functions.
3.  Lastly I think this app could be fun for those who want to study the past performance for a given stock, as 20 years of past data can be charted.

## Working Prototype
You can access a working prototype of the app here: [Chart-the-Market - Beta]( https://guarded-sea-55613.herokuapp.com/)

## Functionality
The app's functionality includes:
* The User has the ability to search for stock symbols based on company names
* The User can then display a chart for the stock symbol
* The User get a chart in both end-of-day and end-of-week prices going back as far as 20 years
* The User can "purchase" stocks and see that stock in their portfolio page
* Lastly the user can "sell" a stock in their portfolio and track their results (ROI(%) and Profit($))

## Technology
* Front-End: React.js | CSS | XML | AnychartAPI
* Back-End: Node.js | Express.js | RESTful API | MongoDB | Mongoose

## Development Roadmap
This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:
* Creation of multiple portfolios that can be separately tracked or compared
* Full dashboard with all information needed at a glance
