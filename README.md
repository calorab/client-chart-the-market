    Here I'm putting a basic plan-of-action and notes for my next steps, issues, etc, to be added as I go.

    Start:
    
    8.20 Created app and bones of app - including chartMain where state will be, charts Display/Data/Controls are children. First iteration is basic with no Auth.
        to do:
            [] Move ChartData to be in ChartMain
            [] Create the Welcome page
            [] Add reactRouter and implement
            [] Download and Create a basic Formik form
            [] Basic CSS for shape and test colors
            [] Create space for API DATA and implement placeholder for graph
            [] ...API...
            [] create toolbar with stats/info to show use of Context 

    8.21 Created basic welcome component structure with features below the picture carousel. The picture carousel was tougher to create without online help (everything I found was old) but it was a good exercise. I think I got it if I can use setInterval to interrupt a map of an array... we'll see. I added the basic logic for it today (hence the asterisk) but it's Friday night so I'm working at a slower pace
        to do:
            [X] Move ChartData to be in ChartMain
            [X*] Create the Welcome page
            [] Add reactRouter and implement {planning for Sunday (8/23)}
            [] Download and Create a basic Formik form
            [] Basic CSS for shape and test colors
            [] Add 404 page not found component
            [] Create space for API DATA and implement placeholder for graph
            [] ...API...
            [] create toolbar with stats/info to show use of Context

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
